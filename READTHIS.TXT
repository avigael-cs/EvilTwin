To anyone who may use this now (Shmuel)
1. Change iface in every .conf files as I had changed it in literally every single one of them
2. open a teminal and perform:var/www/html/passwords

3. type: sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
   and under the </VirtualHost> line paste the following:
   <Directory "/var/www/html">
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteBase /
	RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,L]
	
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ / [L,QSA]
</Directory>

4. enable apache2 rewrite by typing: a2enmod rewrite 
	and follow instructions.

	sudo a2enmod rewrite 
	sudo systemctl restart apache2

	
5. start the apache2 webserver by typing: sudo service apache2 start

6: the main change to make this work was in the file Evil_Twin/config/dns.conf
   see line 28. this is required! this will route the first (or every, idk) request to that   
   address which happens to be where the server is hosted (localhost will work too), 
   so when the user enters it, the portal will open.
